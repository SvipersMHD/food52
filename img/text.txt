Zip Top Reusable Silicone Store & Serve Sets
These reusable storage bags have us bidding farewell to plastic for good. Made of 100% platinum silicone, they stand up so you can jimmy those PB&Js, apple slices, whatever you’ve got, right in. Plus, they zip safely shut for maximum freshness (and minimum mess).

They are perfect for on-the-go lunches and I even take one with me to restaurants as an eco-friendly to-go box—they are so lightweight and can be stuffed into a bag/purse easily. The zip-top closures are very high quality, too.
